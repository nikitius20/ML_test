# ML_test

Task 1

For this I created a Simple Custom Module, that has a learnable parametr "power", or N in y=x^n



Task 2 
For this task I used AutoEncoder

Unfortunately I had come troubles downloading all the dataset, from Google Drive. 
And it only downloaded 40 files, thats what I used, but it should work for 5000
